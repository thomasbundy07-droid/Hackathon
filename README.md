This is a sample submission repository for Tri-Co Hackathon 2025. You can use this repo as a template for your repository, or create your own repo and add this README.md file with the following information about your team

### Team Name

Co2nscious

### Team Members

- Thomas Bundy, Swarthmore College
- Ellis Walker-Keleher, Swarthmore College
- Nico Greene, Haverford College

### Project Description

AI queries, internet searches, and online video streaming consume massive amounts of energy and leave a carbon footprint most users never see. We are looking to make a chrome extension that quantifies the environmental impact of your AI and internet use. While a user is using AI models, social media, or streaming services, Co2nscious will display a widget with live and accuracte emissions calculations of carbon dioxide, water usage and energy usage.

### Protoype Summary

Our prototype displays the emissions information for AI models only. It displays a small widget with data about emissions and digestable equivalents.


### Live URLs

The only URLs availaible for this is our source code on github. You can see the demo in our slideshow though.

### Presentation

[*List any links to your presentation or any related visuals you want to share.*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1McthGHV9SPiwRKKlRL2OEAnRC40NrRm42I7ejrf3zmI/edit?slide=id.g3a3b5d6a9c8_0_1060#slide=id.g3a3b5d6a9c8_0_1060)

### Next Steps

1.Expand the platforms to social media and other streaming services such as Netflix, Instagram, Tiktok, etc.
2.Create a lifetime emissions tracker/historical data of internet use and emissions.
